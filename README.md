**"For Loot And Glory"** is a pirate-themed strategic RPG web browser game powered by POLYGON & CHAINLINK. It will be playable on mobile devices after the mainnet launch. Our objective is to enhance our already robust and longstanding community while presenting a fully decentralized game that doesn't rely on VC funding or the typical model of "invest money, and I'll attempt to develop something for you to play with." We are deliberately taking the opposite approach from other games by granting access to our testnet and providing a free asset for users to engage with. Our aim is for people to enjoy the in-game experience, community interaction, and the opportunity to earn money, albeit with a unique twist. Engaging in an excessive grind is not an option.&#x20;

Firstly, it's crucial to note that, as pioneers in the play-to-earn (P2E) realm, we have carefully observed and identified the factors that have caused other P2E games to fade into obscurity. We have compiled these reasons to guide our development process and avoid making the same mistakes. These recurring issues generally included:

1. _**Constantly required new users/investors to sustain earlier participants' earnings.**_
2. _**Allowed all players to earn rewards without investing further in the game after the initial contribution/mint.**_
3. _**Experienced inflation or hyperinflation of assets and tokens.**_
4. _**Lacked sufficient burn mechanisms.**_
5. _**Suffered from inadequate liquidity in pools.**_
6. _**Exhibited centralization (with the game disappearing if the team vanished).**_
7. _**Faced off-chain security risks.**_
8. _**Were influenced by venture capitalists (VCs), resulting in the VC-dumping of main tokens on regular users/players at certain points.**_
9. _**Lacked true competitiveness among players, as everyone could grind equally.**_
10. _**Teams received excessive funds from minting/initial DEX offerings (IDOs)/initial coin offerings (ICOs), possibly leading them to abandon the game or not put in sufficient effort.**_
11. _**Utilized inadequately tested or centralized blockchains with high gas fees, lacking a backup plan in case of issues.**_





### OUR APPROACH 

1. **Not depending on a specific user count for the economic model to function. Even with just 100 players, committed players can still earn money.**
2. **Introducing gas fees for every action, making it a combination of time spent and gas utilized.**&#x20;
3. **Implementing a halving mechanism for our sole in-game token ($barrels), similar to Bitcoin's, which will be essential for gameplay and most actions. Additionally, those aiming for the lucrative legendary level must be willing to take the risk of burning characters and other assets.**
4. **As mentioned earlier, earning money requires risking asset burning and substantial token usage.**
5. **No need of any pools as the main token cannot be used as such but must "mint" some "bottle of rum". These bottles won't be tokens but NFTs.**
6. **Having everything on-chain, with the front-end (website) mirrored on IPFS, ensuring the game remains playable regardless of circumstances. We consider the project to be 100% decentralized once keys (smart contracts) are thrown away.**
7. **Eliminating off-chain tokens and adopting a similar approach for the website.**
8. **No external secretive deals.**
9. **Reserving substantial rewards, the treasure chest (end-game), for dedicated players. Others can also profit with their assets by selling them, spending some time and fees in-game.**
10. **We don't receive any revenue from the PVE buildings, pirate NFTs, or PVP building mints, except for a recently introduced "secret" asset. This asset serves as an optional and non-essential game bonus, available for less than 10 Matic. Additionally, there will be no token sales. Our potential earnings will constitute a small percentage of the gas fees utilized by players and NFT royalties. That's the extent of it. All remaining proceeds will directly flow into the treasure chests for players to win or be distributed to building owners (further details provided in the documentation).**
11. **Using Polygon, a well-established, PoS-based blockchain that is considered safe, but with contingency plans to migrate if necessary.**

We believe we have resolved the issues observed in other projects and are confident that our game will stand out. Welcome to our Pirate's lair!\
