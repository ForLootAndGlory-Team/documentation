# Introduction

\
\
**FLAG Pirate's Landing & FLAG Pirate's Rampage** is a _Pirate-themed strategic RPG web browser game powered by POLYGON. It will be playable on mobile soon after mainnet._ \
_Our goal is to grow our already very strong and long term existing community while offering a fully decentralized game that doesn't rely on VCs funding or modele like "give me your money and I'll try to code you something to play with". We are doing - purposely - the exact opposite of every other games out there by offering access to our testnet and a free asset for people to get in. We want people to have fun, in-game as much as within the community as much as the opportunity to make money but with a twist. Grind-our-game-to-hell is not an option. On a side note, ror the RP lovers, there will be a full RP section within discord._&#x20;

_Firstly, it's important to mention that, as p2e pionneers, we have carefully watched and noticed what made all p2e games fall into oblivion and kept the reasons on a list to elaborate ours and avoiding the same mistakes. These reasons were most of the time the same._\
\
**What most projects did :** \
**1.** Requires new users to join all the time (to keep paying those who arrived earlier)\
**2.** All players could get rewarded without spending a cent into the game after the initial investment\
**3.** Inflation / hyperinflation of assets and tokens \
**4.** No sufficient burn mechanisms\
**5.** Insufficient liquidity (pools)\
**6.** Centralization (if the team disappear, the game disappear too. Understand here the need of the backend / database that could vanish if the team dies, forced to stop the game by an entity etc..) \
**7.** Off-chain security risks \
**8.** VC's (most games had their main token dumped by the VC's on the regular users/players at some point)\
**9.**  No real competitiveness between players, everyone able to grind\
**10.** Teams gets too much money from mint/IDO/ICO and could be tempted to just run away or abandon their own game or simply not putting a lot of efforts.\
**11.** Using a blockchain that is not sufficiently tested and/or centralized and/or high gas fees and on top of it, with no plan B if something goes wrong where they built\
\
**What we decided to do :**\
**1.** Not necessary to make the economic modele work. If there is only 100 players, the try-hard ones will still be able to make money. \
**2.** Every actions requires gas fees. So it's time spent + gas spent\
**3.** The only token will have a halving such as the one on bitcoin + will be extremely necessary to actually play the game and needed for almost all actions. On the asset side, everyone who would like to reach the end-game, the legendary level where the money can be made, will have to take the risk to actually burn the characters and other assets. \
**4.** As mentioned above, to make money, you need to take the risk to burn your assets and need to use a lot of the token.\
**5.** Depending on the numbers of early players we get we have 2 solutions which will be announced soon after mainnet. Both will provide sufficient liquidity. \
**6.** Everything is on-chain. And the front (website) will have a copy on IPFS, meaning that whatever happens, the entire game will be playable. We consider the project to be 99% decentralized. It depends more on on-chain datas and smart contracts use than anything else. The 1% left is the potential need of a small DB for assets metadatas but we are working hard to find a solution to bypass the need of that database. _(For the tech nerds, the RPC allows a max limit of 100k lenght to load ARRAY that could be an issue for our marketplace and whales)_\
**7.** There is no off-chain tokens and for the website and else, see above.\
**8.** Even though some people already asked us if they could invest into the game, we simply refused. There is NO one getting some tokens or assets under a secretive deal. \
**9.** Only the try-hard players can actually win big (the treasure chest) \
**10.** We don't get any cent from the pve buildings/ pirate nfts / pvp buildings mints besides a small secret assets we created recently that will be a non-mandatory non indispensable game bonus costing less than 10 matic to those who wish to have it. Also there will be no token sales. The money we could make will be a small percent of the gas fees used by players + NFTs royalties. That's it. Everything else going straight into the treasure chests for the players to win or to buildings owners (more described within the doc). \
**11.** We are using Polygon that is a safe, old enough, highly tested one. But its a PoS and we know the risks that comes with it. Governance even if it sounds "cool" and all, can also become the trojan horse of the space (remember tornado cash story?...) so we have already a few back up plans to migrate everything somewhere else if it is needed (and yes, PoW chains are in it)\
\
\
_We hope and believe we removed all issues we saw elsewhere and have a strong confidence that our game will actually make the difference._ \
