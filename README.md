# Buying FLAG

## How to buy FLAG and where

Hello ! If you’re here then you’re probably wondering, how do I buy this tokenand you’re in the right place !

### 1st step : Use Polygon network

On your Metamask, you can see multiple networks on the top right. So you can go there and select the Polygon network.

### If you don’t have Polygon network

Alright, you don’t have Polygon on your Metamask, it’s fine, we’re gonna add it. Go to your Settings down the profile picture menu.

After that, you scroll down a bit and reach the Networks tab.

Down the list, you can press the Add Network button.![](../.gitbook/assets/Capture\_decran\_2022-01-19\_a\_16.30.52.png)

After pressing the button, depending on your version of Metamask, you’ll have the same menu. It’s just that for some people, it’ll open in the browser and for others, it’ll appear in the browser extension.

And in those blocks, place the following information to add the Polygon Network.

Network Name: Matic

New RPC URL:[https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com/](https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com/)

ChainID: 137

Symbol: MATIC

Block Explorer URL:[https://explorer.matic.network/](https://explorer.matic.network/)

### 2nd step (after adding funds) : Swapping for FLAG

Alright so now that we’re setup, we can go on KyberSwap to get some FLAG.

After clicking the link, you will have this prompt coming up, press Import.

Just enter the amount of FLAG you want, and use the token you want (not necessarily WMATIC) to get some FLAG ! You will just have to confirm a transaction after pressing the button, either to approve the currency you’re trying to use, or simply to swap !
