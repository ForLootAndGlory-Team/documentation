# Liquidity Mining

This guide was kindly put together by one of our mods to be easy to digest for those newer to this space. This is also the second Strategy with moderate risk involved.

Now we've covered a lot of basics in the [**liquidity-providing**](../tools-and-features/yield-farming-flag-guides.md) section (please read it first if it's not done already), you should all be thinking,

_Mmmmh, but tell me ser when I bought my FLAG tokens, I had to swap them against MATIC tokens ... does this mean that there is a liquidity pool somewhere with FLAG and MATIC ?"_

Well... EXACTLY ! You basically used the FLAG/MATIC liquidity pool existing on KyberSwap, that you can find here : [https://analytics.kyberswap.com/classic/polygon/pool/0xcfe88814f8ef4bcefeb4483046b7229511e8aa06](https://analytics.kyberswap.com/classic/polygon/pool/0xcfe88814f8ef4bcefeb4483046b7229511e8aa06)

And now, you might be starting to think : _"But ser, if there is a liquidity pool, maybe I can become a liquidity provider and be rewarded for that good job ser ?"_

And one more time, you'll be 100% right ! And that is exactly what we're gonna cover in this 2nd strategy/tutorial : how to become a liquidity provider (LP) on the FLAG/MATIC pool and how to be rewarded for it

**First part (the most important) : performance & risk level** Yes, you'll never stop hearing that (expecially here in FLAG because we care for you), but the first thing to do when you consider to invest some money is to DYOR (Do Your Own Research) ! Lucky day for you, we've done it for you for this one.

We consider this strategy as an intermediate-risk one, for the following reasons :

* first of all, both tokens involved here are not stable, which means than you may face some IL (Impermanent Loss) when volatility comes on one or both tokens, that is something that you need to understand and accept.
* besides, FLAG token is still a very young token, thus it might logically be more volatile than BTC and expose you more to IL. This is why this strategy is for us more risky than the first one described in [**liquidity-providing**](https://www.notion.so/Yield-Farming-FLAG-Guides-af8c7332c4044447823ab8a57507033e).
* however, we consider that the FLAG project is very solid (yes, we trust in ourselves ^^) and much more transparent than other projects/tokens you could invest on Beefy for example. So logically liquidity mining based on FLAG token looks less risky for us than the 3rd and last strategy.
* besides, the APR of this strategy (around 160% at the time I'm writing this) is very interesting and should easily compensate your potential IL losses.
* last point, this strategy doesn't involve any lock, i.e. you can at any moment claim your rewards and convert back your LP tokens to MATIC & FLAG if you feel uncomfortable with your position.

**Second part : how to **~~**lambo**~~** FLAG liquidity providing** This strategy is composed of two major steps that we'll fully detail here :

1. get FLAG/MATIC LP token on KyberSwap
2. stake these LP tokens on our app to generate rewards

Let's move to our beloved KyberSwap to start. To provide liquidity to the pool, you need first .... to own liquidity. Surprising, isn't it ?

You will thus need to own a bag with 50% of its value in FLAG and the other 50% in MATIC. _Example: you want to invest 100$ on this strategy, you'll then need 50$ of FLAG and 50$ of MATIC on your wallet. This can be 25 FLAG and 25 MATIC, or 1 FLAG and 25 MATIC, it doesn't matter, the value ratio must be 50/50._

Do the swaps you need on KyberSwap, I shall not need to explain this again here as you're not noobs anymore Once you have them, you can now go on the Liquidity Adding page (Pool > Add) :[https://kyberswap.com/add/MATIC/0x9111d6446ac5b88a84cf06425c6286658368542f](https://kyberswap.com/add/MATIC/0x9111d6446ac5b88a84cf06425c6286658368542f/0xcfe88814f8ef4bcefeb4483046b7229511e8aa06?networkId=137)

**Useful info here** : you can see live the ratio FLAG/MATIC. Always interesting to know the ratio when you enter the pool, since it allows you to quickly estimate the tokens you'll get when you decide to leave the pool (don't worry, there are tools for that if you don't wanna bother ^^).

&#x20;                                       <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (2).png" alt="" data-size="original">

Once you've set the amounts related to each token, you can approve the LP token and confirm adding liquidity. As soon as the tx is validated, you should not see the tokens in your wallet anymore, but the LP tokens instead (for that you'll probably need to dig on [polygonscan](https://polygonscan.com/) with your wallet ID, since the LP token won't be imported by default in your non-custodial wallet). Congratulations, you are now a FLAG liquidity provider !

**Third step : how to **~~**get the real lambo**~~** mine the rewards**

_Ser, I'm very happy to provide liquidity, but where is da money ser ?"_

Well, the money is very close ! Now you own some LP tokens, head towards the Liquidity Mining page of our app :[https://app.forlootandglory.io/liquidity-mining](https://app.forlootandglory.io/liquidity-mining)

You can stake your LP tokens there (don't forget to do the approval the first time, and only once, before trying to stake) and start accumulating $FLAG rewards !

Indeed, everyday the pool is rewarding all the liquidity providers who staked their LPs, proportionally to their share of the pool, with a total daily emission of 547 FLAG.

_Example: the bag you invested represents 1% of the total pool size -> by staking your LP tokens you will earn 1% of 547 FLAG (i.e. 5.47 FLAG) everyday._

As mentioned earlier, there is no "lock" on the staking of the LP token, so everyone is able to claim his rewards or sell whenever he wants; which adds a bit more flexibility than the FLAG staking.

Here you go, ready to save for the lambo.
