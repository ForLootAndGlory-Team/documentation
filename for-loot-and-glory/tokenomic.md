## $FLAG TOKEN

The Guild Token $FLAG is capped at a _Max Supply_ of **1,000,000 Tokens**. After _the first two sales phases_, _the remaining supply_ is mined by liquidity providers.The $FLAG token _identify members_, give _roles_ based on the number of tokens in their wallet, and pay “Royalties”. Later on, it will be the Governance Token (used for voting).



There was **three sale phases :**

* The **private presale (8.4%)** at a fixed price reserved for members who have participated in the _Test-net_ of the Dapp and in the building of the community and the _Discord_.
* The **public presale (7.6%)**
* The _**IDO**_\* **(80%)** , to launch a decentralized exchange pool, bring trading volume to **$FLAG**, and provide access to returns for those who provide liquidity.

&#x20;_\*IDO = Initial Dex Offering. This is a fundraising event that results in the release of a token on a decentralized exchange platform such as Uniswap)_

## $FLAG Road Map

During the _First Sale_ phase all funds went directly into the guild vault in MATIC. Once the _first phase_ was over, we launched the first event to validate the Guild Model with the community and we paid the _first “Royalties”_ 30 days after the end of the presale. These “_Royalties”_ were 10% and all the rest reinvested to grow the chest. We will launch the _Second Phase_ of pre-sale after these _“Royalties”_ are paid. During the Second Phase of sales and until the IDO was launched, the chest have reinvested all of its capital into various performance tools to begin growing the financial capacity of the guild. We started investing the Vault in various NFT Gaming _Metasoccer_ (Youth Scouting), _Crypto Raiders_ (Recruiting/Minting events and _$RAIDER_ Token staking to farm _$AURUM_) and new NFT games that meanwhile get released on _Polygon_ and _Ethereum_.

### $FLAG Audit

The _$FLAG_, _Guild Chest_ and “_Royalties”_ will be entirely managed by Smart Contracts. Once the _Smart Contract_ of the Mainnet was launched have _audited_ it to _ensure reliability_ and make the _$FLAG Token_ and _“Royalty”_ functions _Open Source_ for all members. The audit is public and can be found on [Broken link](broken-reference "mention")

## Objective&#x20;

The ultimate goal of the guild is to use the vault and its yield to _provide access to Play To Earn games_ (that can get expensive very quickly) and _share the revenue_ that the guild generates. Once the vault was launched, some _events_ are free to members, and others can require a fee (if the vault yield is insufficient to fund them) as long as the event provides the guild with a good return on investment. The first 6 months of the guild were important for the growth of the chest, the main purpose is to give intrinsic value to the Guild Token ($FLAG) using the returns of the raised funds. As of today, all went well according to our plans despite the market conditions.
