# Yield Farming FLAG Guides

**Yield Farming For Loot And Glory Guide** We would like to offer you a tutorial on Decentralized Finance or DeFi, we will explain to you the risks, the functions, and 3 types of savings techniques that we have been using for our own fund for some time.

**What is a Liquidity Pool**? Liquidity Pools are reserves of tokens locked in a smart contract. They are used in various projects, such as decentralized exchange platforms or lending protocols. Thus, these reserves are used by two types of actors: _Liquidity providers_. _The users of these liquidities_. On one hand, cash providers deposit tokens into the pool in exchange for a reward (fees, interest, etc.). On the other hand, users of the cash access the cash to perform various actions such as trading or borrowing. Before we understand how they work, let's look at the problem they solve.

**Why Liquidity Pools?** As we have seen, these common liquidity pools are used by protocols with diametrically opposed goals. Indeed, they are used by decentralized exchange protocols (DEXs) such as Uniswap or Balancer, as well as by lending protocols such as Compound or Aave. In all of these cases, they meet the same need: to ensure the presence of liquidity, at all times, in the protocol. The case of decentralized exchanges seems to be the best one to understand their utility. You are probably familiar with services like Coinbase or Binance. These trading platforms operate through a system called an order book.

**How does a Liquidity Pool work**? Their operation is relatively basic. Liquidity providers supply tokens in exchange for a reward. After that, anyone can use the liquidity according to the mechanisms of the protocol.

**Uniswap** As this is the most obvious example, we will describe how Uniswap pools work. In this case, the liquidity providers deposit a pair of assets, for example, the DAI/ETH pair. A 50/50 ratio is set by the protocol, so when a user adds 1 ETH to this pair, he must bring the same value in DAI. Subsequently, anyone wishing to trade either asset will tap on one side of the pool by depositing on the other. For example, if we want to exchange ETH into DAI, the protocol takes our ETH and sends us the corresponding DAI value in exchange. To ensure that the protocol always has liquidity, it uses an automatic market maker formula. Thus, when a swap is made, the amount returned is based on the ratio between the two tokens in the pool (in our case ETH/DAI). However, the larger the order you place relative to the size of the pool, the worse the rate you will get as the ratio moves along the curve. This phenomenon is called slippage.

Obviously, other protocols use different formulas. For example, Balancer allows you to create pools with different ratios than the classic 50/50. For their part, lending protocols also use liquidity pools with a relatively similar operation.

**Yield Farming**

This strategy consists of putting your crypto at the disposal of a DeFi platform to earn tokens. To do this, you can choose between several tools or techniques including:

```
Investing in a cash pool
Investing your funds on a DEX exchange
Lending crypto on a dedicated application
```

**How Yield Farming works**

From a global point of view, the functioning of Yield Farming is relatively simple.

```
The Yield Farmer blocks his cryptos for a set period of time on a DeFi protocol or in a wallet.
These funds will be borrowed from other Internet users.
The investor receives regular interest rates and/or transaction fees.
The broker also rewards the Yield Farmer in governance tokens for his investment. He can then resell them to 
materialize his gains.
```

DeFi Yield Farming can therefore be considered as a liquidity mining strategy. The investor provides funds to generate the creation of tokens.

I advise you to use Beefy only when you have already well understood all the mechanics of the pools and all the risks that are behind the farming. Do not hesitate to ask us questions, I will be happy to answer you when I am available, I hope you will choose the farming rather than buying your Pegaxy, This will teach you to manage a savings on the long term to start earning interest from the crypto economy, learning to save is to open the door to a much more stable life without stress, learn to take care of your earnings over time and this is the only way to stay alive in the crypto market where you can very easily lose everything with the wrong protocol, the wrong timing, or the wrong people..
