# Earn & Endgame

Hey pirates, here's the juicy bit: how to earn in the FLAG pirate game. \
\
**THE MARKETPLACE WILL BE YOUR BEST FRIEND BUT NOT ONLY**&#x20;

* Sell unused characters.
* Sell spare tickets.
* Sell surplus FLAG Pirate NFTs.
* Sell Bottles of Rum.
* Sell extra Gears.
* Sell leftover Coins. (PvE)
* Sell your Chests. (PvP)
* Sell services from buildings if you own some: Brothel, Forge, Shipyard.
* FLAG stakers: earn from in-game fees.



**AND, THE BIG FINAL LOOT FROM THE CROWN OF GOLD (ENDGAME)**

* Go full legendary without burning your character and get access to the big treasure chest... \[PVP] this is by far the biggest prize anyone can get.\
