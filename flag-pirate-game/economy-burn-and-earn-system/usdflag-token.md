\
FLAG token is a super low supply token : 1.000.000. Using our rare token was NOT a good idea. This is precisely where many other play-to-earn games have failed. Distributing your project's token in this manner can lead to hyper-inflation, and only a substantial burning mechanism can help regulate its price. This approach isn't healthy, and it's how you end up negatively impacting your loyal holders with a non-stop dumping price. Instead, let  us explain how the FLAG token will provide value to everyone.

Twenty percent of the in-game fees will be automatically added to the vault. This 20% will be used to buy back FLAG tokens, which will then be redistributed to our stakers. The vault will adjust the daily emissions to ensure a consistent distribution over a five-year period. Since we're buying back FLAG tokens, regular holders and speculators will also benefit.

Now, what about the gamers? It will be highly recommended to stake some FLAG tokens, as the total amount you stake will determine the generous Bottle of Rum's discounts on in-game actions that require its use. To give you an idea : 10.000 staked FLAG = 80% discount!\
