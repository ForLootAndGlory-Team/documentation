FLAG token is a super low supply token : 1.000.000. let  us explain how the FLAG token will provide value to everyone.

Twenty percent of the premium building fees and hundred percent of FLAG fees during quest map, will be automatically added to the Royalty staking reward reserve, which will then be redistributed to our stakers. The royalty will adjust the daily emissions to ensure a consistent distribution over a five-year period. Since we're buying back FLAG tokens, regular holders and speculators will also benefit.

Now, what about the gamers? It will be highly recommended to stake some FLAG tokens, as the total amount you stake will determine the generous Bottle of Rum's discounts on in-game actions that require its use. To give you an idea : 10.000 staked FLAG = 80% discount!\
