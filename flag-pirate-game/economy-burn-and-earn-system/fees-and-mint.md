# Fees & Mint

**ASSETS MINT - Automatically managed by smart contracts**\
91% of the mint from all buildings goes to the end-game chest (for the players/winners reaching the end-game) and 9% kept by the team to pay back some game's expenses.\

**Secret Airdrop**\
For every building's ?????Members will also be able to get more by buying some during the mint. If some are sold during the building's mint, the money generated goes to the founders. It is a small item that is not indispensable to play the game, a small bonus that will apply to some assets under certain conditions.\


**FEES - Automatically managed by smart contracts**\
We believe that makes the game sustainable on the economic side is the fact that each actions within the game requires a transaction fees. It is also the cost of running a fully decentralized game and removing the safety issues that comes with a off-chain tokens and a database. Without it, it would be a grind-to-earn and we all know where this ends. The end-game rewards have a quite big potential in terms of earning since it comprise the money from the mint + these transactions. To earn big, you need to invest. To invest you need to spend more than a single asset bought at the beginning of a game. That's what - we believe -  will keep the game being economically interesting for a long time, within what we expect and hope to be an eternal cycle that repeats itself. Of course, this depends on few factors but even if there is not many players or not many assets bought, there will still be an interesting amount to get when a player reach the end-game. And so, there will be people interested on getting that reward if no one goes after it. If it create interest among few people, there will still be some people paying these fees and growing the amount of money in the end-game chest. Which will bring more people to try, which will grow the chest even bigger and so on. Here are how these fees will be managed (by smart contracts) : \
\
90% of the fees are sent to the end-game chest\
10% to pay the team\
\
**BUILDING PREMIUM - Automatically managed by smart contracts**\
80% for the owner and 20% for the protocol in $FLAG. The total amount paid by a player for the building's premium have the same fees conditions as described above.\
