**In details :** \
No Pirate’s life without a brothel ! This building can give you a stats bonus for hunts. To make it work, the owner must have a character staked inside and the character must have his Bottle of Rum. 10 Bottle of Rum = 1 use. The bonus you can get is available for 20 hunts but be careful, you must use the 20 before coming back to get more. However, it is possible to squash them if the bonus don't suit you to get new ones.   Each Brothel use gives EXP to the whoremonger, that level up his skills. \
\
The max level is 100. Once reached, the whoremonger can give 100 more bonuses then dies (burn). A new character will be needed or no gears can be crafted.   Bonus (buff) : if the whoremonger is at 139 EXP = bonus of 139 stats.  The bonus rarity only work for specific hunts (rare bonus asked can only be used for rare hunt etc.)  Debuff : visiting a brothel can also make the bonus obtained inactive, the girls of the brothel leaving you a small gift when you leave, its name: "gonorrhoea". If you get it, on top of being a dirty mfer, you will also lose the bonus effect you freshly obtained.   \
\
To get the bonus there is a fee to pay in Matic as for the Forge with the same conditions 80% owner 20% protocol.  Each time the brothel is visited, the whoremonger gains EXP according to the rarity requested (common +2XP, rare +6XP, legendary +12XP). The higher the whoremonger EXP is, the more the “Filles de joies” inside give a good bonus.   The premium is an amount in matic that the building’s owner can add to his building for the users who would come to use it.  \
\
Public/Private mode : In Public, everyone can use the building, in Private, only the owner can use it. \
