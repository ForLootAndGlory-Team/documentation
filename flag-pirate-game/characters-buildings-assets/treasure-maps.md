According to its statistics, it will have a chance to win the treasure hunts. The treasure hunt gives you EXP + treasure maps if you succeed. If you lose, you get less EXP than if you had won + no maps. You need EXP to level up the characters. You need to reach a certain level to be able to hunt rare (30) and legendary hunts (70). Same to get rare and legendary gears. Legendary maps will be needed for Chapter II / endgame.    If you win a Hunt you will get 100 maps.  For the Common : +6 EXP  For the Rare : +12 XP. \
 For the Legendary : +200 EXP.  There is a chance of characters burn for the legendary. And if you lose : 1 EXP. \
