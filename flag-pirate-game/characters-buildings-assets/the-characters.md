**In details :** \
ERC721 - Polygon. These are your Pirates. They can be minted using the tickets your PIRATE NFT gives you once a month. 1 Ticket = 3 mintable characters for free.\
There is 3 kinds of characters. the Smuggler (1) The Corsair 2) and the Pirate (3). These classes will make sense later in Chapter II but will have no importance during Chapter I.\
\
All characters come naked (no gears) and at level zero, with randomly generated stats using chainlink (boarding, charisma and navigation). Gears are composed of : Head, chest, main hand, leg, feet. Their stats are part of the character’s total stats and can be obtained in the Forge building in exchange for maps. More about this can be found at the Forge description.\
\
The characters will be useful for treasure hunt to bring treasure maps & EXP. You need EXP to level up the characters. EXP will matter during all game’s chapters. More about this can be found at the Hunt description. Later on, it will be used for PVP too (Chapter II).

\
Character's Career : The characters can be assigned within one of the buildings. They can become a Blacksmith in the Forge, a whoremonger in the Brothel and a secret one, only available later on in Chapter II. When the character is assigned in a building it is permanent and he cannot be removed or change his career.\
