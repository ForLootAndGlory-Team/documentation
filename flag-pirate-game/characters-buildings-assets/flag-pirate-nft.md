**In details :** \
ERC721a - Polygon. Essential to get access to the in-game characters. First utility is to use it to mint a ticket. The ticket is used to mint 3 ingame characters.\
There will be different parts and a bit of rarity but purely for fun. There is no impact in-game, so don’t get too excited if you mint the rarest PIRATE NFT. Their sole purpose is to mint Tickets with which you can mint the game’s characters but we won’t get mad seeing you wandering around with it as a PFP. Owning one allows you to mint 1 Ticket (ERC1155) and with the ticket, you can mint 3 playable characters. A cooldown of 1 month will start after your first Ticket mint. The cooldown length will depend on the characters total circulating supply and so, can change with time. Each current FLAG stakers get 1 for every 100 FLAG they stake.  Outsiders can also get one.
