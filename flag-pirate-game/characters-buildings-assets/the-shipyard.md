**In details :** \
&#x20;\
The Shipyard enables players to build magnificent ships that serve as the core of their maritime escapades. Choose from three distinct ship types, each tailored to a specific class (Pirate, Corsair, or Smuggler), and set sail to conquer the seas! More about the kind of Ships can be found in the next page "The Ships". To make it work, the owner must have a character staked inside the Shipyard. The character will become a Shipwright. The Shipwright will need Bottle Of Rum to be productive and deliver his services. Each ship built requires 10 Bottle of Rum. Each use of the Shipyard gives the Shipwright EXP, which levels up his skills. The maximum level is 100. Once reached, the Shipwright can built 100 more ships/equipments, then the character dies (burns). A new character will be needed, or no ships can be crafted nor equipments (see below)

In the Shipyard, players can also use the services of the skilled Shipwright to craft powerful equipment for their ships. To create ship equipments, players must provide the Shipwright with special chests obtained from PvP "Odysseys". Each type of chest corresponds to a specific rarity level of ship equipment. To craft ship equipment, players must exchange the appropriate chests with the Shipwright, who will then start the crafting process. The Shipwright's experience and craftsmanship play a vital role, as higher-level Shipwrights have a greater chance of producing more powerful and valuable equipment.\
Public/Private mode : In Public, everyone can use the building, in Private, only the owner can use it.â€¨\
The premium is an amount in FLAG that the building's owner can add for the users who come to use it.

(Note: The Shipyard's crafting system is designed to offer a dynamic and engaging experience for players, and adjustments may be made to ensure a balanced and enjoyable gameplay.)

Each time the building is used to build equipments , the Shipwright gains EXP according to the rarity of the chests used: +3XP for common, +24XP for rare, or +72XP for legendary. The more experienced the Shipwright is, the better the stats of the crafted equipments will be. \
When building a ship, the Shipwright gets 30XP. \
