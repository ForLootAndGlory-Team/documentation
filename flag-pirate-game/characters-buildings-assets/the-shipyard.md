**Detailed Guide:**

The Shipyard is a critical facility where players can build ships and craft ship equipment, essential for succeeding in maritime adventures and PvP "Odysseys." This system allows for the production of three specific ship types associated with the classes Pirate, Corsair, and Smuggler.

**Character and Resource Management:**

* A character must be staked in the Shipyard to become a Shipwright.
* **Cost BEP:** Craft a common stuff cost 1 BEP , rare stuff cost 3 BEP, legendary stuff cost 5 BEP, craft a ship cost 10 BEP

**Experience and Longevity:**

* Each operation at the Shipyard provides the Shipwright with experience (EXP), enhancing their ability to produce higher quality ships and equipment.
* The Shipwright gains 30XP per ship constructed.
* For equipment crafting, the EXP gained depends on the chest's rarity used: +4XP for common, +24XP for rare, or +72XP for legendary.
* A Shipwright can reach a maximum level of 100, after which they can build 100 more ships or pieces of equipment before expiring. A new character must then be assigned.

**Crafting Equipment:**

* Players can craft equipment by providing the Shipwright with chests obtained from various Odysseys.
* The type of chest (Common, Rare, Legendary) determines the rarity of the equipment crafted.

**Chests and Equipment Rarities:**

* **Common Chest:** Obtained from Seafarer's Run Odyssey, crafts common ship equipment.
* **Rare Chest:** Obtained from Plunderer's Quest Odyssey, crafts rare ship equipment.
* **Legendary Chest:** Obtained from Siren's Call Odyssey, crafts legendary ship equipment.

**Public/Private Mode:**

* In Public mode, anyone can use the Shipyard.
