\
**In details :** \
This building can be obtained by mint. It produce the only ingame token which is $RHUM (rum in French). $RHUM is produced as soon as the building is staked. You can claim your $RHUM whenever you want clicking the "claim" button under each tavern within the Dapp. Note that this building do not need to have a character assigned to it.  

To Level up the tavern it cost 20 Matic\* + 1000 $RHUM for level 1 and after +20% of $RHUM for each additional levels. The Matic price is fixed no matter what level you level up to. You get +10% of $RHUM production per level. \
\
 A halving on the general production is triggered if the total $RHUM circulating supply goes above 1.000.000. The halving is automatically cancelled if it goes below.   \
\
_\*The amount may sound expensive but it regulates the $RHUM production and raise consequently the endgame rewards. The money goes straight to the end-game and so, goes back to the winners (PVP Chapter II)._   \
