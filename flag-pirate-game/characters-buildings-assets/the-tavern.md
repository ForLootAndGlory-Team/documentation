**Detailed Guide:**

**Minting and Staking Process:**

* **Minting:** Obtain a Tavern by minting.
* **Staking:** Once staked in the dApp, the Tavern begins producing $BARRELS of Rum.

**$BARRELS Claiming:**

* Claim your $BARRELS using the "claim" button found under each tavern within the dApp interface. You can claim at any time, allowing flexibility in managing your resources.

**Leveling Up Tavern:**

* **Cost:** To level up the tavern, it costs 0.2 rETH + 1000 $BARRELS for the first level. Each subsequent level requires an additional +20% of $BARRELS.
* **Fixed rETH Cost:** The rETH price remains the same regardless of the level.
* **Production Bonus:** Each level increases $BARRELS production by +10%.

**Production Halving Mechanism:**

* If the total circulating supply of $BARRELS exceeds 1,000,000, a halving of general production is triggered to maintain balance. This halving is automatically reversed if the supply drops below this threshold.

**Bottling Process:**

* Convert $BARRELS into Bottles of Rum by clicking "Bottling" above your Tavern. This conversion is crucial as 1 $BARREL equals 100 Bottles of Rum, which can then be used by characters or sold on the marketplace.

**Economic and Strategic Impact:**

* The pricing and leveling costs are designed to regulate $BARRELS production and enhance endgame rewards. All funds from this process contribute directly to end-game payouts, benefitting PvP Chapter II winners.\
