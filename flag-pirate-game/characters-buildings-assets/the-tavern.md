<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/TAVERN=.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**In brief :** \
\- 999 in total will be available to mint\
\- Stake it using the dapp to produce $rhum\
\- To stake go to Town -> Tavern -> Stake button\
\- Works without character assigned to it\
\- Produce $Barrels (ERC20) of Rum that can be converted into bottles (ERC1155)\
\- Use Rum $Barrels produced\
\- Sell Rum Bottles produced\
\- Level it up to produce +10% more $Barrels![](../../.gitbook/assets/barrel.png) at each level up\
\- Give $rhum to your characters for them to be able to do everything within the game\
\
**In details :** \
This building can be obtained by mint. It produce Rum's $Barrels once the building is staked. You can claim your $Barrels whenever you want clicking the "claim" button under each tavern within the Dapp. Note that this building do not need to have a character assigned to it.  

To Level up the tavern it cost 20 Matic\* + 1000 $Barrels for level 1 and after +20% of $Barrels for each additional levels. The Matic price is fixed no matter what level you level up to. You get +10% of $Barrels production per level. \
\
 A halving on the general production is triggered if the total $Barrels circulating supply goes above 1.000.000. The halving is automatically cancelled if it goes below.   \
\
_\*The amount may sound expensive but it regulates the_ $Barrels _production and raise consequently the endgame rewards. The money goes straight to the end-game and so, goes back to the winners (PVP Chapter II)._   \
