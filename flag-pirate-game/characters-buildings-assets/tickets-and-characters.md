There are three types of characters: the Smuggler (1), the Corsair (2), and the Pirate (3). These classes will gain significance later in Chapter II but won't hold much importance during Chapter I.

All characters start without gear and at level zero, featuring randomly generated stats for boarding, charisma, and navigation using Chainlink. Gears consist of items like Head, chest, main hand, leg, feet. These gear stats contribute to the character's overall attributes and can be obtained in the Forge building in exchange for Coins. Further details about this can be found in the Forge description.

Characters serve a purpose in treasure hunts to acquire Coins and EXP. Experience points are essential for leveling up characters, and their significance will persist throughout all chapters of the game. For more information, refer to the Hunt description. In later stages, EXP will also be relevant for PvP (Chapter II).

Character's Career: Characters can be assigned to various buildings. They can become a Blacksmith in the Forge, a Whoremonger in the Brothel, and a Shipwright in the Shipyard. Once a character is assigned to a building, the decision is permanent, and they cannot be removed or change their career.\
