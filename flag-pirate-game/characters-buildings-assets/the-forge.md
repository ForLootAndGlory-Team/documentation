**In details :** \
The Forge will be needed to craft gears for the characters. To make it work, the owner must have a character staked inside. The character will become a Blacksmith. The Blacksmith will need $RHUM to be productive and deliver his services . 10 $RHUM = 1 use (to craft a gear).   Each Forge use gives the Blacksmith EXP that level up his skills. \
\
The max level is 100. Once reached, the Blacksmith can craft 100 more gears then dies (burn). A new character will be needed or no gears can be crafted.   To craft gear (main hand, leg, feet, head, chest), there is a fee in matic + 1000 Coins (depending on the price at the time of the link\* to generate the stats of the equipment + depending on the premium that the owner has set)  Of these fees, 80% goes to the building owner and 20% to the protocol (see “money generated” for detailed information).   The gear crafted will have stats randomly generated by Chainlink.   You need Silver Coins to get rare gears. You need Gold Coins to get legendary gears. \
\
Each time the building is used, the Blacksmith gains EXP according to the rarity of the Coins used. +2XP for common +6XP for rare or +12XP for legendary. The more experienced the Blacksmith is the better the stats of the crafted gear will be too.   The premium is an amount in matic that the building’s owner can add to his building for the users who would come to use it.  Public/Private mode : In Public, everyone can use the building, in Private, only the owner can use it.  \
