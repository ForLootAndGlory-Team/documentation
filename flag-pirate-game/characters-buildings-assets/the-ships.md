#### Ship Construction

To craft a ship there is a fee in matic. Of these fees, 80% goes to the building owner, and 20% goes to the protocol (see "money generated" for detailed information). The ship built will have stats randomly generated by Chainlink. Once generated, each ship comes with various bonuses, represented as percentage increases ranging from 5% to 15%, based on the Shipwright's level. The type of ship depends on the character's class and each character can only create one ship:&#x20;

* **Pirate**: Builds a Caravel.
* **Corsair**: Builds a Schooner.
* **Smuggler**: Builds a Square Rig.



#### Stat Bonuses

Ship classes provide specific stat bonuses:

* **Caravel**: Provides a boarding bonus.
* **Schooner**: Provides a charisma bonus.
* **Square Rig**: Provides a sailing bonus.
