# Quick starting guide

You want to avoid reading all the pages and start playing ? Alright mfers here is your quick lazy starting guide.&#x20;

## TESTNET (PVE)

Within the testnet, you have full access to all assets from the game like if you own it. (tickets, characters, forge, tavern, brothel for now and later on during the full testnet also access to the PVP assets) _**Requirements :**_ \
_- Metamask on Mumbai testnet network_\
_- Mumbai testnet token_ [_https://faucet.polygon.technology/_](https://faucet.polygon.technology/)\
\
**How and where to start :**&#x20;

1. Click "mint" and mint some taverns. Minting one will automatically mint a PIRATE NFT to give you some tickets to mint ingame characters.&#x20;
2. Click "town" and stake the tavern to produce $BARRELS.
3. Go to "town" and "collectible" tab and "mint ticket". You'll receive your 3 playable characters.
4. Go to "town" on the left sidebar and click "characters". Recruit your characters. (1 ticket gives 1 of each)
5. Wait for the Tavern to produce $rhum. Go to Town to see if there is some to claim. If so, claim it
6. Once you got some $BARRELS, go to "the sea" to start PVE by selecting how many "hunts" you want to do (button on the left of "hunt" under each characters)
7. Click hunt, you will see how many "Coins" you got
8. The character needs Bottle of Rum to go on hunts. When it is first minted, it comes with 20 drinks free but once used, you will need to add more for any action you would want to make with your characters.&#x20;
9. You will need to put a character inside the forge and the brothel to make it work. The characters will also need Bottle of Rum to work properly.&#x20;
10. Using the forge will give you gears / using the brothel will give you bonuses for the hunts.&#x20;

There is more to do that you can easily discover wandering around the game. From here you should be able to navigate within the dapps and able to play. If you need more informations, please ask us in discord on the testnet chans.&#x20;
