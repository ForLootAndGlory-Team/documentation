# PVE mode

**The Chapter I - Pirate's Landing is the PVE mode.** \
The objective:

* Enhance your characters' levels through experience points (EXP) and crafted Gears using the Forge.
* Level-up your Tavern.
* Acquire the most exceptional gears available.
* Engage in the production of $BARRELS (if you own a tavern).
* Embark on Treasure Hunts to gather Coins and the accompanying EXP.

The progression begins with Copper Coins. Upon reaching level 30, you can access Silver Coins. Upon reaching level 70, you gain access to Gold Coins.

All actions undertaken in the PVE mode will be essential for Chapter II. Achieving the Legendary level and obtaining Gold Coins are imperative for the end-game experience.\
