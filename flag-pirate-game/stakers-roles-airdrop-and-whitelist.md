# Stakers, Roles, Airdrop & Whitelist

Depending on your stake, you can access different chans within discord and have access to special prices and rewards as a staker. Here are all roles available. Note that the first level role was recently created to give access to the free Pirate NFT owners and super small stakers with less than 100 FLAG. The full server access always was and will be minimum 100 FLAG staked. Read carefully. \
