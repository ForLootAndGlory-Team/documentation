**Chapter II - Pirate's Rampage**

In the PvP (Player versus Player) mode, players immerse themselves in exhilarating naval battles, vying for treasures and renown on the expansive waters. Each voyage spans 7 days, and to take part, players need to fulfill particular prerequisites:

* Own a ship outfitted with a Captain: A player at level 100, completely equipped with legendary gear.
* Hold bottles of rum: These are vital for enhancing a character's performance during battles.

**Battle Mechanics - The Odyssey**

Time to sail! Once an Odyssey is launched, players can either be attacked by other ships or initiate attacks on other players' ships present in the same Odyssey. Each battle consists of three stages: sailing, charisma, and boarding.

1. **Sailing Battle**: In this stage, the ships engage in a battle based on their "sailing" statistics. The attacker rolls dice, aiming to exceed half of the defender's sailing value. The attacker's dice have a range from zero to the total sailing value of the attacker.
2. **Charisma Battle**: Similar to the sailing battle, the charisma battle involves rolling dice to exceed half of the defender's charisma value, with a dice range from zero to the total charisma value of the attacker.
3. **Boarding Battle**: The final stage, boarding, determines the outcome of close combat. As with the previous stages, the attacker rolls dice within the range of zero to their total boarding value, trying to exceed half of the defender's boarding value.

**Victorious Outcome**

The player who wins the majority of the battle stages emerges victorious and gains the spoils of war. They steal a portion of the cargo from the defeated player's ship. However, if a player's cargo is completely emptied during the Odyssey, their journey ends, and they receive no rewards.

On the other hand, if a player's ship survives the battles, they earn a "Chest" reward containing an amount equal to their remaining cargo. Additionally, they receive a bonus based on the number of battles they experienced during the voyage, further enhancing their overall standing in the game.

### PvP Mode: High-Seas Adventures

In the exciting Player versus Player (PvP) mode, players set sail on thrilling voyages to engage in intense naval battles and claim victory over rival ships. There are three distinct voyage types, each offering unique challenges and rewards:

#### 1. Seafarer's Run (Common Odyssey)

* **Duration**: 7 days.
* **Defeat Protection**: 24 hours.
* **Starting Cargo**: 500 bottles of rum.
* **Stake per Attack**: 100 bottles of rum.

#### 2. Plunderer's Quest (Rare Odyssey)

* **Duration**: 7 days.
* **Defeat Protection**: 12 hours.
* **Starting Cargo**: 5000 bottles of rum.

#### 3. Siren's Call (Legendary Odyssey)

During these daring Odysseys, players must assemble a formidable crew, led by a Level 100 character equipped with legendary gears, and stockpile enough bottles of rum to endure the treacherous sea battles that await. The higher the stakes, the greater the rewards, but the risks are equally high, as defeat may result in the loss of valuable cargo and resources.

Players must carefully strategize their attacks, making use of their ship's unique bonuses and crew's skills to outmaneuver opponents and seize their cargoes. Successful battles can lead to tremendous spoils, and those who emerge victorious will be rewarded with riches, fame, and the respect of their fellow pirates.
