# Decentralization & Our Game

_"The Centralization is the concentration of control under a single authority. It requires complete trust and madness. I would not fully trust my own self so I could I give it away to someone else?"_\


The entire game is on-chain with a frontend mirror on IPFS (deployed shortly after full live mainnet)  .  The entire game can work without any human intervention, it only needs players  . All actions performed by the player are done through smarts contracts that can not be modified  . The fees generated by the buildings are automatically transferred by smart contract to where it belongs (see [fees-and-mint.md](../flag-pirate-game/economy-burn-and-earn-system/fees-and-mint.md "mention"))\
\
  The players end-game earnings are also automated by smart contract.\
The different money movements are also all managed by smart contract without a possibility of modification after deployment  . The game chest is not held by any key, by any entity. The team can't technically touch the funds.   The token in the pool will be frozen. Therefore, a rug will technically be impossible.\
\
   To make it simple, the team has no control after deployment of the game apart from the technical aspect of the operations (but these access will also be destroyed after confirmation that no bug is left unfixed), has no access to the funds generated and if all the team had to disappear, the game was designed so that it can continue to operate both technically and financially in a completely autonomous manner and without the slightest human intervention. \
