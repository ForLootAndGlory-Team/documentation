# Privacy Guide

We would like to give our community a few guidelines on how to protect your privacy while navigating the crypto world. Nothing here will 100% protect it but will considerably act as a shield against all intrusions we suffer more and more by the day. \
\
**METAMASK & INFURA**

Most ignore this but MetaMask privacy policy is very clear : they spy on you. Problem is, we can only speculate about the why's. It's not about having nothing to hide, it is solely about refusing to be spied on whatever the reasons given. We have a fundamental right to privacy and we should always fight for it. First, you need to know that MetaMask belongs to ConsenSys that also owns Infura. How they technically "get in" is through the use of their RPC. The Infura RPC that is not removable from MetaMask (of course...) \
\
**What sensible datas they take when you use it ?** \
\- Your IP address (and therefore, your location...)\
\- The wallets used \
\- What funds you have\
\- What protocols you use\
Pretty much, everything you do...&#x20;

\
\
**HOW TO GET YOUR PRIVACY BACK** \
\
**Solution 1 :** If you want to keep using MetaMask\
Set-up your own RPCs BEFORE setting-up your wallet.\
You can get a full updated list of privacy preserving RPC on [ChainList](https://chainlist.org/) \
But be sure to check from time to time if the RPC you use is still preserving your privacy.\
We recommend for ethereum / polygon the use of the "llama" RPC that is open source and maximise your privacy safety since a while now. \
<mark style="color:red;">Warning :</mark> It has been tested by few devs that even doing this won't stop Infura to discretly collect all your datas..\
&#x20;\
**Solution 2 :** Get rid of MetaMask _\[recommended]_\
There is few other wallets that are more or less easy to use and offers automatic protection. \
Feel free to search around but we like to use right now [BlockWallet](https://blockwallet.io/index.html). \
It is not a perfect one as there is still some little bugs here and there but overall, we prefer privacy over perfect app fluidity. It is a tiny bit slower than MetaMask and encounter some minor bugs but the wallet has been built precisely to protect your privacy. The wallet has a built-in swap function that will also provides privacy protection when you want to exchange some tokens. \


\
**WHAT ABOUT WEB 3 WEBSITES AND DEXs ?** \
&#x20;\
As you might guess, the problem is also there. Uniswap, Sushiswap, Opensea etc. etc. etc. \
Most of them for legal reasons or just for a lack of crypto-ethos also get informations from you when you use their services. The best you can do is using a protective wallet + use a VPN. And if you have the skills and the patience, and when it is possible, use smart contracts Write Function instead of using a website front-end.\
\
\
**COULD WE EVER GET A FULLY TRULY DECENTRALIZED, PRIVACY PRESERVING CRYPTO-LIFE ?**\
\
For now, it is almost an utopy because at the end of the day, we still rely on the internet provider and of course, power. As of today its not complete but partially possible. There is few tools that allows us to be off the grid when it comes to our cryptoworld and FLAG tried its best to use the maximum out of it while keeping the indispensable user-friendly interface. Here are few tools that gives some true decentralization : \
\
\- IPFS \
\- BITCOIN NETWORK\
\- OPEN SOURCE CODES\
