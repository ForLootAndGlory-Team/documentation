# Request a scholarship

To request a scholarship, access to the 'Request Scholarship' tab available under the 'Scholarship' section of the left-hand menu:

From there, you have access to the list of games for which you can apply for a scholarship through our dApp, and the number of people queuing for each game:

Before applying for a scholarship on any game, make sure to have a look at how the game works and what is doable or not being a scholar. If you have any question, do not hesitate to ask on our Discord server.&#x20;

Once you've made your choice about a game, the first thing you'll have to do is to **approve FLAG token** (only once). Indeed, any request concerning scholarship is **on-chain** and **subject to FLAG fees** (depending upon your role), thus giving approval on FLAG token is needed to use the related smart contracts. Please note that you'll also need a wee bit of MATIC to pay the gas fees and validate the transactions !

You can approve FLAG token by clicking on any of the related button, then validating the transaction popping up:

Once the transaction validated, a similar message box shall pop up in the top-right corner:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Congrats, first step succeeded pirate !</p></figcaption></figure>

**Refresh the page**, and you should then be able to request a scholarship for the game you want:

Please find below the details of the **FLAG request fees** according to your role:

* for <mark style="color:green;">Fresh-water sailors</mark> : 0.01 FLAG per request
* for <mark style="color:blue;">Looters</mark> & <mark style="color:purple;">Fleet commanders</mark> : FREE ayeeeee :heart:

Make sure to have enough FLAG in your wallet (if you need some) before requesting, otherwise the transaction won't show up and you'll get this error message:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Dammit, you need more FLAG pirate !</p></figcaption></figure>

Once the transaction initiated and validated, you should see a similar message box:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Congrats pirate, welcome to the scholar crew ! <span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="1f389">ðŸŽ‰</span></p></figcaption></figure>

**Refresh the page**, and you should see that your request has been taken into account and that you've been added in the queue ('Number in queue' incremented):

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>First to request LFG <span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="1f525">ðŸ”¥</span></p></figcaption></figure>

Now you just have to wait and enjoy the assets when they're delegated to you !

&#x20;**Last but not least**, some additional information:

* you <mark style="color:green;">**CAN**</mark>** ** apply for different games at the same time ! You'll then join the different queues and get the different assets accordingly.
* you <mark style="color:red;">**CANNOT**</mark>** ** apply again for a game for which you're already in the request queue ! Your first request must first be fulfilled before requesting again.&#x20;
