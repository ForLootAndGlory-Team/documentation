# Delegate a scholarship

**1. Delegating assets from games not added yet to our dApp** _(new)_\
The easiest way is to ask us to add a new game where delegations to scholars will be made possible. For this, just go to our Discord server, open a ticket and make your request. One of our admin will review your request and will add the game to the FLAG website's dashboard. You will be notified once your request has been processed and will be able to delegate using the method described below. \
\
**2. Using the existing games present in our dApp**\
The delegation is a free service for our <mark style="color:purple;">Fleet commanders</mark> (i.e. the members staking at least 500 FLAG, refer to [Broken link](broken-reference "mention")). If you are not a Fleet commander, a fee apply to delegate assets. The fee is 0.01 FLAG per asset delegated _(fee price will be adjust to FLAG price fluctuation)._&#x20;

To use this service, access to the **"Delegate Scholarship"** tab available under the **"Scholarship"** section of the left-hand menu. Scholars comes to the dashboard and request a slot. Once a request is made under the game you want to delegate asset from, you simply click on the **"accept request"** button that will appear under the game's name.&#x20;

Every time a member makes a scholarship request, a notification will pop on our discord under **#request-created**. This way, you can see if there is already request for the game you are looking for scholars. If there is none, simply go to the game's dedicated channels within discord and tell the members you are looking for scholars. They will quickly go to the website to make some requests. From there, you can see the first-in-queue request for each game. If you're owning assets and would like to delegate through scholarships, you can use this feature to manage your delegations !

* :star: Access rating information of the requesting member
* :scroll: Add some personal notes about this delegation in the first text box
* :e-mail: Add some instructions for the scholar in the second one (your contact details for example)
* :white\_check\_mark: Use the Accept button and validate the poppin' transaction once you're ready !

Once the transaction is confirmed, you can get in contact with your freshly promoted scholar in order to setup the scholarship and start earning passive income :fire: Head towards your personal Dashboard to access any information about your current asset delegations and update if needed the memos shared with your scholars. See the [dashboard.md](dashboard.md "mention") for more informations regarding notations and scholars managing. __&#x20;
