# Migration V1 to V2 $FLAG Token

### Introduction

We will see all the steps to move from your token V1 $FLAG to your token V2 $FLAG, why this migration to a new token?&#x20;

Following the March update on polygon Heimdall a number of people are still unable to withdraw their $FLAG from the Royalty, so we have a first point to settle, unlock its users. Secondly, we need to make FLAG available on ETH mainnet and Polygon in case of staking our future NFT with FLAG in rewards, this upgrade will also allow us to update the code of our token to make it lighter in gas cost.

#### Royalty

We will leave 3 days after the announcement of the beginning of the migration for you to recover your rewards, then the V1 Royalty contract will be frozen and you will be able to recover the frozen sale via our migration page, this page will be activated once all the contracts set to 0 rewards and the Royalty contract frozen.
