# How to use the vault

[**ADDING FUNDS IN THE VAULT**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]

1. Use the "deposit" of your choice depending of the pool you chose. (flag/weth or flag/matic)&#x20;
2. add the amount of the single token you want to add (or flag or matic or weth)
3. Approve it (metamask is triggered and will ask your approval to use the token amount you chose)
4. Click "Stake" (metamask is triggered and will ask you to validate your staking) \
   and thats it ! Nothing more is needed, the vault will take care of everything.&#x20;

**Note :** To withdraw, its exactly the same process except you use the "withdraw" function instead of "deposit"
