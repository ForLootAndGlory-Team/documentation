# Our Auto compounding vaults

The vault system is a feature that allows users to compound their rewards and earn additional gains through high-yield investments. Basically, it adds the LP rewards automatically without the need to claim, swap, create new LP tokens and add it. All of this is made automatically once you add your first LP into the pool. \
\
Plus, we added an extra "lazy" mode for the very lazy mfers. Now you can create, add, withdraw with the "single token" mode. Imagine you want to add liquidity to the FLAG/WETH pool but you only have WETH. Well, go to the "single FLAG/WETH" and add your WETH. The Dapp will swap, create the LP token and add it to the pool automatically. Magic !\
If you are noob, go to [kyberswap.md](kyberswap.md "mention")to learn how to use the vault or to [liquidity-mining.md](../liquidity-mining.md "mention")if you don't want to auto-compound the rewards and use the normal pool. The vault performance fees are 5% and withdraw fees 0%.

#### Once the vault is fed, you would be able to follow your investments with the dashboard
