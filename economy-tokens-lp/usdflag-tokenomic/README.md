## ROYALTY STAKERS

We started as a guild made of investors investing into play 2 earn games. With the first token sale we used the funds to also invest into games and profits were distributed to the stakers. (most assets were rented out to "scholars" that also were stakers. In exchange of staking and having access to all assets, they were also given a 90% cut / share of the profit made within the games. the 10% left were distributed amongs all stakers).\
\
As of today, thanks to these first investments, we secured 2,7 years of royalties distribution among our stakers. Our game will gives us the opportunity to add even more to it.\
\
Now that we stopped investing into others games and building our own, the stakers are rewarded differently. There is still the daily FLAG emission from the 2,7 years secured. 18% of the ingame fees are gonna be automatically added to the vault. Those 18% are used ot buy back FLAG to be then given to our stakers.  The system that is gonna be in place will add 2,3 years to the royalty distribution to reach a 5 years of FLAG distribution. The vault will automatically adjust the daily emission to always keep a 5 years distribution. It might sounds a bit complicated so don't hesitate to ask the team within the discord server if it isn't clear.&#x20;
