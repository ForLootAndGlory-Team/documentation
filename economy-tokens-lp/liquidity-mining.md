# Liquidity Mining - Noob Guide

If you don't want to use the vault, you can use the regular liquidity mining pools. This guide was kindly put together by one of our mods to be easy to digest for those newer to this space.&#x20;

**FLAG liquidity providing**

1. get FLAG/MATIC LP token or FLAG/WETH on KyberSwap
2. stake these LP tokens on our app to generate rewards

To provide liquidity to the pool, you need first .... to own liquidity.&#x20;

You will thus need to own a bag with 50% of its value in FLAG and the other 50% in MATIC or WETH depending on the pool you want to use. _Example made with FLAG/MATIC: you want to invest 100$ on this strategy, you'll then need 50$ of FLAG and 50$ of MATIC on your wallet. This can be 25 FLAG and 25 MATIC, or 1 FLAG and 25 MATIC, it doesn't matter, the value ratio must be 50/50._

Do the swaps you need on KyberSwap, I shall not need to explain this again here as you're not noobs anymore Once you have them, you can now go on the Liquidity Adding page (Pool > Add) :[https://kyberswap.com/add/MATIC/0x9111d6446ac5b88a84cf06425c6286658368542f](https://kyberswap.com/add/MATIC/0x9111d6446ac5b88a84cf06425c6286658368542f/0xcfe88814f8ef4bcefeb4483046b7229511e8aa06?networkId=137)

**Useful info here** : you can see live the ratio FLAG/MATIC. Always interesting to know the ratio when you enter the pool, since it allows you to quickly estimate the tokens you'll get when you decide to leave the pool (don't worry, there are tools for that if you don't wanna bother ^^).

Once you've set the amounts related to each token, you can approve the LP token and confirm adding liquidity. As soon as the tx is validated, you should not see the tokens in your wallet anymore, but the LP tokens instead (for that you'll probably need to dig on [polygonscan](https://polygonscan.com/) with your wallet ID, since the LP token won't be imported by default in your non-custodial wallet). Congratulations, you are now a FLAG liquidity provider !

**Third step :** mine the rewards

_-"Ser, I'm very happy to provide liquidity, but where is da money ser ?"_

Well, the money is very close ! Now you own some LP tokens, head towards the Liquidity Mining page of our app :[https://app.forlootandglory.io/liquidity-mining](https://app.forlootandglory.io/liquidity-mining)

You can stake your LP tokens there (don't forget to do the approval the first time, and only once, before trying to stake) and start accumulating $FLAG rewards !

Indeed, everyday the pool is rewarding all the liquidity providers who staked their LPs, proportionally to their share of the pool, with a total daily emission of 250 flag per pool.

_Example: the bag you invested represents 1% of the total pool size -> by staking your LP tokens you will earn 1% of 547 FLAG (i.e. 5.47 FLAG) everyday._

As mentioned earlier, there is no "lock" on the staking of the LP token, so everyone is able to claim his rewards or sell whenever he wants; which adds a bit more flexibility than the FLAG staking.

Here you go, ready to save for the lambo.
