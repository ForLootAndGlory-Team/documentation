<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/flag rhum (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* $BARRELS will be the ingame utility token within the FLAG game.&#x20;
* There is no total supply. It is produced in the TAVERN building.&#x20;
* No presale / IDO / ICO etc...&#x20;
* No MaRkEtInG / AdVisOrS or team allocations
* The daily emission per Tavern is : \[TBA]
* The total emission per day will be regulated by a halving similar to the one on Bitcoin. Each time the total circulating supply goes above 1.000.000, a halving occurs. If it goes below, the halving is automatically cancelled. \
  \
  \
  \*this is the base but few changes could occur before mainnet launch.&#x20;
