#### BARRELS Token Overview

**General Information:**

* **Utility Token:** $BARRELS serves as the in-game utility token for the FLAG game.
* **Production Site:** Produced exclusively in the TAVERN building.
* **Conversion:** Each $BARRELS can be converted into 100 Bottles of Rum, used for various game functions.
* **No Initial Sale:** There will be no presale, Initial DEX Offering (IDO), Initial Coin Offering (ICO), or similar launch events.
* **Allocation:** No allocations for marketing, advisors, or the team.

**Emission Details:**

* **Daily Emission Rate:** The specific daily emission per Tavern is to be announced (TBA).
*   **Regulation Mechanism:** The total daily emission is controlled by a halving mechanism, similar to Bitcoinâ€™s supply regulation:

    * **Halving Trigger:** A halving in production occurs each time the total circulating supply of $BARRELS exceeds 1,000,000.
    * **Cancellation of Halving:** If the circulating supply falls below 1,000,000, the halving is automatically cancelled, reverting to the previous emission rate.\
