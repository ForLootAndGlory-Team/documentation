# $RHUM Tokenomic



<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/flag rhum (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* $RHUM will be the ingame utility token within the FLAG game.&#x20;
* There is no total supply. It is produced in the TAVERN building.&#x20;
* We might use a pre-mint to fill the $rhum pool to make it liquid enough from day 1 (not fully determined yet, we try to explore all options)
* No presale / IDO / ICO etc...&#x20;
* No MaRkEtInG / AdVisOrS or team allocations
* The daily emission per Tavern is : \[TBA]
* The total emission per day will be regulated by a halving similar to the one on Bitcoin. Each time the total circulating supply goes above 1.000.000, a halving occurs. If it goes below, the halving is automatically cancelled.&#x20;
* There will be a RHUM/MATIC Pool. The MATIC liquidity will be automatically provided by the funds raised through the asset's mint (see above for the RHUM). This pool will have a double use case. It will serve as the "end-game treasure chest"  and as a regular pool, allowing people to buy and sell $RHUM.\

  \*this is the base but few changes could occur before mainnet launch.&#x20;
