* $BARRELS will be the ingame utility token within the FLAG game.&#x20;
* There is no total supply
* It is produced in the TAVERN building
* Each $BARRELS can produce 100 Bottles of Rum
* No presale / IDO / ICO etc...&#x20;
* No MaRkEtInG / AdVisOrS or team allocations
* The daily emission per Tavern is : \[TBA]
* The total emission per day will be regulated by a halving similar to the one on Bitcoin. Each time the total circulating supply goes above 1.000.000, a halving occurs. If it goes below, the halving is automatically cancelled. \
