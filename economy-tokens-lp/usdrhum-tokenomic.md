# $RHUM Tokenomic

* $RHUM will be the ingame utility token within the FLAG game.&#x20;
* There is no total supply. It is produced in the TAVERN building.&#x20;
* The daily emission per Tavern is : \[TBA]
* The total emission per day will be regulated by a halving similar to the one on Bitcoin. Each time the total circulating supply goes above 1.000.000, a halving occurs. It it goes below, the halving is automatically cancelled.&#x20;
* There will be a RHUM/MATIC Pool. The liquidity will be provided by the funds raised through the asset's mint. It will basically be the "end-game treasure chest" allowing people to buy and sell $RHUM and to get their rewards if one successfully reach the end-game. \
